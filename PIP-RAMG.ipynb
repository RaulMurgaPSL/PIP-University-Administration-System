    "#### iii. Search Operations â€“\n",
    "1. Search student details by collage and academic year.\n",
    "2. Search student details by stream and academic year\n",
    "3. Find the percentage of specific student after exam.\n",
    "4. Find the marks of specific student after exam.\n",
    "#### iv. Count Operation â€“\n",

    "2. Delete Collage Streams\n",
    "3. Delete Student details as per collage name and year\n",
    "#### vii. Fill Exam form\n",
    "1. This Button perform the Fill Exam Form operation on college\n",
    "information from College object and student information from\n",
    "Student object. Which will be initialize the student academic\n",
    "subject for Exam result.\n",
    "#### viii. Appear for Exam\n",

    "document.\n",
    "#### xi. Deploy your code to Cloud (AWS/ Azure / Google App Engine )\n",
    "i. Choose a Hosting Provider: Using cloud will give you\n",
    "a good start in learning about deploying Python code\n",
    "to the web as it strikes a balance between\n",
    "abstracting away complexity and allowing you to\n",
    "customize the setup.\n",
    "ii. When choosing a web hosting provider, you need\n",
    "to confirm that it supports running Python code.\n",
    "Many of them cost money, but this case study will\n",
    "stick with a free option thatâ€™s professional and\n",
    "highly scalable yet still reasonable to set\n",
    "up:eg: Google App Engine.\n",
    "iii. Note: Google App Engine enforces daily quotas for\n",
    "each application. If your web application exceeds\n",
    "these quotas, then Google will start billing you. If\n",
    "youâ€™re a new Google Cloud customer, then you can\n",
    "get a promotional free credit when signing up.\n",
    "iv. Google App Engine is part of the Google Cloud\n",
    "Platform (GCP), which is run by Google and\n",
    "represents one of the big cloud providers, along\n",
    "with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services\n",

    "\n",
    "#### c) Modifying the University Administration system Web App to Connect to a\n",
    "Backend Datastore\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d) Create Services that will act as connectors to map the external requests to\n",
    "the destination pods so that we can access the pods externally without\n",
    "entering the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### e) Increase the number of replicas running the application by updating the\n",
    "replicas field of a Deployment spec.( scale a Kubernetes application up and\n",
    "down.)"
